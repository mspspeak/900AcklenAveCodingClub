*Problem 2*

Math (?) Practice

In this problem we're going to create a program that generates math problems we need to answer and practice answering quickly.

First your program will show directions.

For example:
"You will have 60 seconds to answer as many math questions as you can.
Answer each math question with the number and hit RETURN.
To start the Math Race game hit RETURN."

The play will hit the "RETURN" key (or a button, etc).

(You will start some kind of timer...)

Then questions will show.

You can choose the kinds of math problems you want.  (Maybe use a random number generator to pick questions?)

5 + 5 = ?

6 x 3 = ?

234 x 16 = ?

It might be fun to just test simple math facts.

They will continue to answer them.

Then when the timer goes off OR the player answers one but the 60 seconds has elapsed (whichever, use your ideas), you show them how many they got.

Feel free to mix it up.  Draw pictures.  It could be "count the number of letters" or "How mny speling misteaks are in this santence?"  ... or trivia about Zelda, etc.  It doesn't have to be a minute either.  You could extend it.

Have fun!  Race your family!
